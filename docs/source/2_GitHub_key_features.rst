Teams
=====

In GitHub organizations, teams group members to simplify permission management. 
Only organization members can join teams, external collaborators are excluded.
Teams can be nested to reflect the project structure: 
child teams automatically inherit their parent's access permissions. 
In practice, parent teams should have permissions suitable for all their members, 
while child teams can be granted additional access depending on project needs.

Each team can have one or more maintainers who manage its settings, description, and membership.

For more details, see the 
`official GitHub Documentation <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams>`_
