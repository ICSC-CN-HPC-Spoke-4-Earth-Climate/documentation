Teams
-----

GitHub organizations `teams <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams>`_ are groups of organization members.
They can only include organization members,
i.e. outside collaborators cannot be part of a team.
Multiple levels of nested teams can be created,
to mirror the hierarchy of the project.
Child teams inherit parent's access permissions.
In general, parent teams repositories access permissions
should be safe for every member of the parent teams and its child teams,
while moving towards the bottom of the hierarchy additional permission
can be granted depending on the needs of the working groups.

.. _par_team_maintainers:

`Team maintainers <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/assigning-the-team-maintainer-role-to-a-team-member>`_
can access team settings and update team description and profile picture.
They are allowed to `add <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team>`_
and `remove <https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/removing-organization-members-from-a-team>`_ organization members to their team.
