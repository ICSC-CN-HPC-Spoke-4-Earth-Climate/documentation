Adding a User to the GitHub Organization

once the necessary agreements and requests have been made.

Steps:
1. **Prepare the request**

   - Complete the user request table (see :ref:`Memberships & Teams Management`).

2. **Invite the user**  
   - Go to the **People** tab of the organization.  
   - Click on the **Invite member** button.

3. **Set membership type**  
   - Select **Member** (do not select Owner!).

4. **Assign teams**  
   - Add the invited user to the relevant WP/Innovation Grant team.  
   - If applicable, also add them to the second-level team, 
     according to the structure previously agreed with the WP Leader.

5. **Send the invitation**  
   - Click **Send Invitation**.  
   - The invited user will receive an email and 
     has **7 days** to accept and join the organization.
