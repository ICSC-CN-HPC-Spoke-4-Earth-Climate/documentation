   - Complete the user request table (see :ref:`Memberships & Teams Management`).

2. **Invite the user**

   - Go to the **People** tab of the organization. 
   - Click on the **Invite member** button.

3. **Set membership type**

   - Select **Member** (do not select Owner!).

4. **Assign teams**

   - Add the invited user to the relevant WP/Innovation Grant team.  
   - If applicable, also add them to the second-level team, 
     according to the structure previously agreed with the WP Leader.

5. **Send the invitation** 

   - Click **Send Invitation**.  
   - The invited user will receive an email and 
     has **7 days** to accept and join the organization.

Further details on this process can be 
found in the official GitHub documentation:
